title: MimicPlay on Franka Arm and its Extension
description: This blog is part of our universityâ€™s project lab, where we are working on replicating MimicPlay using a real one-arm robotic platform in our lab. Building on this setup, we aim to extend the approach to bi-manual systems such as the Tiago robot. Our work explores how abundant human play data can be leveraged to guide efficient low-level robot policies.
